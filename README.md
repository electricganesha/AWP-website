## Tech
The website was developed in HTML/CSS/Javascript and features interactive animated menus and responsive design.

## The Book
'Um Poema Errante / A Wandering Poem' is the printed collaboration between travelling poet Christian Marques and visual interpreter Angharad Hengyu Owen. A literary project unlike anything that has ever been published, it embodies a bi-disciplinary re-exploration of an eight-month journey from Europe, across the Middle East, to Asia: Undertaken by the author himself, crossing seven countries, covering roughly 11'500 kilometers by land, unearthing one poem a day. The result is a bilingual (English and Portuguese) collection of emotional imprints, where each poetic free-verse works hand in hand with its unique visualisation on paper, offering a multi-layered and inner-directed reading experience, and ultimately a voyage of sorts through printed words.

## The Makers
Christian Marques, the author, 
is a Software Engineer with an appetite for the arts and the unknown. Among his cultural interests, a strong component traverses all his endeavours: storytelling. A firm lover of narrative, in all its beautiful manifestations, it becomes evident in the songs he composes, the photos he takes, and of course the poems he writes. He is also an advocate of radical travel, an activity which embodies the starting point for ‘A Wandering Poem’, as it was an eight-month journey that laid the foundations for its creation. Currently, Christian is working on new ways of digital immersive storytelling, through his recently formed company, PUSH.

Angharad Hengyu Owen, the designer, 
loves language, the significance and insignificance of meaning. Her practice has allowed her to explore the realms of graphic design, photography, moving imagery, and multimedia installations, yet she remains fascinated most by words, carefully placing and shifting letters in space: Growing visuals out of narratives. Since successfully completing the BA (hons) Graphic Design & Illustration course at Cambridge School of Visual and Performing Arts, Angharad continues to pursue the art of visual storytelling through mindful experimentation, developing an intricate yet minimalist style.
